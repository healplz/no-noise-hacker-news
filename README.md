# Chrome pluging: No Noise Hacker News

Do you ever get tired of all the noise on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/)? 

This is the source of a chrome extensions hiding stories from all domains that - per november 2015 - had more than than 2500 stories submitted but having less than 4 votes on 60% of submissions. See script.js for more details on what is filtered.

### Todo
* Let the top bar icon get color when stories have been removed
* Clicking on the top bar icon gives you the option to reload the page with no noice removed
* Let people add and remove domains by them self

_PR very welcome_
