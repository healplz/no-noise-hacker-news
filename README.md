# No Noise Hacker News - Chrome browser extension

[![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome%20browser%3F%20-%20Install%20extension-brightgreen.svg)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-noise-hacker-news/meeppdmpplgpkpgdlnhfagmplkmkjhnm/)

Do you ever wish you could filter [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to avoid the noise? I am talking about the noise from big websites trying to push their content to HN hoping for a bigger audience. 

## Why
I have a feeling some websites sometimes think "_Let us push (all) the content and let the community sort out what is interesting_" while flooding the feed like a [Kudzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu_in_the_United_States) of stories shadowing the light of attention (especially in the "new" section).



This is the source of [the chrome extension No Noise Hacker News](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-noise-hacker-news/meeppdmpplgpkpgdlnhfagmplkmkjhnm/) that filteres away stories from domains that - per november 2015 - had more than than 2500 submitted stories but less than 40% had more than 3 votes. See [`src/script.js`](https://github.com/mathiasrw/no-noise-hacker-news/blob/master/src/script.js) for more details on how the domains where found.

## Todo
* Let the top bar icon get color when stories have been filtered
* Clicking on the top bar icon gives you the option to reload the page with no stories filtered
* Let the list of domains be updated with data for 2016 or the last X days
* Let people add and remove listed domains by themself


_PR very welcome_


## But?

#### Is this censoring? 
- No, this is a way of limiting domains with a high amount of noise. 

#### Will it hide a really interesting storry?
- Yes, but any story that is number 1 will never be filtered (so if its really good, you will still see it)

#### How can I see if anything is being filtered?
The sequense of numbers at the left side will skip the ordner of natural numbers.

#### I really want to see what is being filtered?
Open the page in incognito mode to avoid filtering anything. 

#### Can I alter the list of domains beinf filtered?
- Not right now, but that is where I want to go with this plugin. PRs are very welcome.
